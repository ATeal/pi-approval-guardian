# prime-approval-guardian

This private alpha package provides a fail-closed whole-cell Approval Guardian for Prime Agent 0.7.x. It is not a Pi extension and is not published yet.

The extension intercepts every Prime Agent `ipython` call, normalizes the exact complete cell, and reviews it before execution. It uses an explicitly registered reviewer model when supplied by the host adapter, otherwise it falls back to Prime’s current registered model. Authentication failure, provider failure, timeout, malformed input, incomplete input, and invalid or denying assessments all block the cell.

## Compatibility

- Prime Agent: `>=0.7.2 <0.8.0`
- Node.js: `>=22.8.0`

## Reviewer isolation

The reviewer receives only a new context containing the Guardian system prompt and the normalized whole-cell action. It receives no main-conversation messages and no tools, extensions, skills, project context, IPython, shell, or write capability. Reviewer output must be one strict assessment object.

## Security scope

This alpha covers Prime Agent’s built-in IPython preflight only. It is an approval gate, not an OS sandbox. It does not provide Pi shell/path-tool coverage, Prime configuration files, capability indicators, bypass controls, or grants; those belong to later tickets in #10.

## Native verification

From the repository root, with Prime Agent 0.7.x installed:

```bash
npm run test:prime-native
```

The smoke test packs and installs the artifact into isolated temporary package storage, then exercises Prime’s actual tool-call seam. It verifies injected and nested real-reviewer allow, deny, unavailable authentication, provider failure, timeout, and invalid-assessment paths, plus RPC and daemon-backed blocking. Allowed cells must create the exact expected marker; every blocked path must leave no side effect. Versions outside `>=0.7.2 <0.8.0` fail explicitly.
